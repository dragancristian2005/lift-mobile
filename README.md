# LIFT - Your Gym Companion
> A new way to enjoy working out

### LIFT is a mobile application developed using React Native and NestJS, designed to help people stay healthy and motivated at the gym. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, LIFT provides the tools and motivation you need to reach your fitness goals.
#### On the HomeScreen you can see a Heatmap of all the muscles you worked this week, helping you keep track of your weekly progress. There is also a button that lets you create a new workout, and a information card with the latest completed workout.
